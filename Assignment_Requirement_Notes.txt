R-CNN Model (identify and track multiple objects in video streams)

Data Processing
    * Extract Data Frames in sequence 
    * normalization to Standardize
    * data augmentation techniques such as 
        - random cropping, 
        - flipping
        - color jittering to improve model robustness


Model Development:
    *  R-CNN model for object detection, 
    * fine-tuning it on the selected

Dataset:
    * Integrate a temporal consistency 
    * maintain consistent identities across frames
    * Implement adaptive tracking algorithms 
        - (e.g., Kalman filter or SORT) 
        - adjust tracking parameters based on object speed and direction.


Evaluation:
    * Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as 
        - mean Average Precision (mAP), 
        - tracking accuracy, 
        - identity switch rate.

    * Compare the performance 
        - against baseline models 
        - other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. (Optional)
